substance of the following Sermon was preached at St.
Peter&rsquo;s, <span class="smcap">Lowestoft</span>, on Sunday,
the 19th of August, 1855, after the death and funeral of <span
class="smcap">Mrs. Francis Cunningham</span>, the beloved wife of
the beloved Vicar of the Parish.</p>
<p>With great animation of spirit, and remarkable energy of
natural character; with an unwearied watchfulness over the young,
and a no less laborious care for their parents; with a fervent
missionary spirit, only equalled by her zeal in the work at home;
with real natural eloquence, and an admirable tact in her
intercourse with all kinds of character; with a tender <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>sympathy for
the afflicted, and a most friendly kindness to all who needed
friendship; and above all, with an unceasing spirit of believing
prayer, she laboured for forty years in the parishes of
Pakefield, Kirkly, and Lowestoft, in the happy service of the
Saviour whom she loved; till at length after meekly receiving at
her Lord&rsquo;s hand the gradual decay of voice and strength,
she peacefully fell asleep in Him on August the 12th, 1855.</p>

</blockquote>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This world is full of sorrow, for the simple reason that it is
full of sin, and wherever sin is, separation and sorrow are
certain, sooner or later, to follow in its train.&nbsp; So have
they followed at this present time, for the event that has
brought us together is a separation that has called forth a
general sorrow throughout the place.&nbsp; It has not been merely
respect that has led to so kind and almost universal an
exhibition of feeling throughout your town, for respect is, after
all, but a cold thing, and there has been nothing cold on this
occasion.&nbsp; There has been a deep and tender sympathy, the
mournful sense of real bereavement in very many affectionate
hearts.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Now let
us none suppose that real, true, heartfelt, and sympathizing
sorrow is inconsistent with the christian character, for if such
a thought could be for a moment entertained, it would be removed
at once by the one simple statement, &ldquo;Jesus
wept.&rdquo;&nbsp; The tears of true sorrow, therefore, are in
perfect harmony with the character of Christ.&nbsp; Sorrow is not
eradicated by the Gospel, but has its character changed by
it.&nbsp; The Holy Spirit does not harden the heart against
grief, but comforts the mourner in the midst of it.&nbsp; The
deep waters are not frozen, so that the child of God can coldly
walk across dry footed; but they retain their character, and are
deep waters still; and the believer is held up in passing through
them, so that, though deep, they cannot overflow him.&nbsp; The
effect is much the same as that of the coloured glass upon the
light; the light shines still, but a new hue is given to
it.&nbsp; Just so is it with sorrow.&nbsp; Like the light it
remains within the soul, and is not extinguished by the power of
grace; but like the light passing through the coloured glass, <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>it acquires a
new colouring, and is beautifully softened by the sacred hope
presented to us in Christ Jesus.&nbsp; Thus the passage does not
simply say &ldquo;that ye sorrow not,&rdquo; for if it did, it
would imply that grief was sinful, but it says &ldquo;that ye
sorrow not even as others that have no hope,&rdquo; so teaching
us that through still felt, sorrow may be softened within the
heart.</p>
<p>The passage also teaches what is the principle by which this
change is to be effected, viz: hope; for when there is no hope,
there is nothing left but the sorrow of the world.&nbsp; I feel
therefore that I cannot select a safer subject for our careful
study on this solemn day.&nbsp; The Spirit indeed appears
especially to have stamped it with his own authority as
peculiarly suitable for such a season, for He has said in v. 18,
&ldquo;Wherefore comfort one another with these
words.&rdquo;&nbsp; May He grant then his own blessing on the
words which shall be now spoken!&nbsp; May He raise our thoughts
to things above!&nbsp; May he teach us to realize the blessed
hope!&nbsp; And may He so <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>make use of the present sorrow as to
prepare our souls for a tearless re-union before the throne of
Jesus!</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The first thing to be noticed in the passage, is the
light which it incidentally throws on the <i>present state of
departed believers</i>.</p>
<p>The prominent point of hope presented to our view is very
clearly the glorious coming of our blessed Lord, with the
accompanying resurrection and reunion of his saints.&nbsp; But
the present position of the soul is three times incidentally
mentioned, and each of these times is described under the
beautiful figure of sleep.&nbsp; Twice are our dear brethren
described as those &ldquo;which are asleep,&rdquo; and once as
those &ldquo;which sleep in Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What then are we to understand by this expression?&nbsp; Are
we to regard it as proving their present state to be one of
unconsciousness or stupor?&nbsp; God forbid! for then how could
such a spirit as hers that has now left us, say, &ldquo;To me to
live is Christ, to die is gain.&rdquo;&nbsp; She could truly say
during her life time, &ldquo;I delight to do thy will O
Lord,&rdquo; <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>and it could be no gain to such an one to sink down into
stupor and inactivity.</p>
<p>But still they are said to sleep in Christ, and the beautiful
suitability of the expression may be seen from two points of
view.</p>
<p>In the first place, death is the separation of the immortal
spirit from the mortal body, and the body alone now lies sleeping
in the grave.&nbsp; When we assembled around that opened grave on
Friday, it was to leave there the body.&nbsp; We committed her
body to the grave, &ldquo;earth to earth, dust to dust, ashes to
ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this body may be justly said to sleep.&nbsp; It sleeps,
for it is without feeling.&nbsp; There is no pain or languor now,
no advancing illness, or exhaustion from decaying strength.&nbsp;
This is all over now, and the poor body sleeps in Jesus.</p>
<p>Then again it is a sleep, for the time of labour has now
passed.&nbsp; That beautiful and cheerful activity which for
twenty-five years has been such a blessing and example to this
place, is now over.&nbsp; The night is come when she cannot work,
and let us who remain learn <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the lesson that while the day lasts,
we must be, like her, most vigorously employed for God.</p>
<p>And lastly it is a sleep, for it is not permanent, but only
for a time.&nbsp; The night is quickly passing; already we see
the streaks of morning; and when the Son of Righteousness
appears, the sleeping body shall spring from the couch of its
slumber, and take its place in the great company before the
throne of a risen Lord.</p>
<p>Thus the body may be well said to sleep in the tomb.&nbsp; But
the immortal spirit who shall fetter, who shall entomb it?&nbsp;
The immortal spirit never sleeps, it needs no sleep, for it knows
no fatigue, and the language of the Scripture is, &ldquo;They
rest not day and night, saying Holy, holy, holy, Lord God
Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rev.
iv, 8.</p>
<p>But again, with reference to the soul itself, the present
state is well represented by the figure of sleep, and for this
reason: that sleep is the season of repose, and the repose of
those we love above is perfect.&nbsp; You <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>remember the
voice heard from heaven, the voice of the Holy Ghost bearing
testimony on this peaceful subject, &ldquo;I heard a voice from
heaven saying unto me, &lsquo;Write, blessed are the dead which
die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea saith the Spirit, that they
may rest from their labours.&rdquo;&nbsp; They rest, therefore,
in sweet repose, but repose is not insensibility.&nbsp; It
involves no want of consciousness, and accordingly you have two
passages apparently conflicting, but really in perfect harmony,
the one saying that they rest, the other that they rest not, for
the one refers to labours, the other to thanksgiving; the one
describes the perfection of repose, the other the equal
perfection of joyous, unceasing, and unfatigued activity.</p>
<p>Thus as to all that shall harass, distress, and grieve, there
is repose or sleep.&nbsp; The world may be distracted by war and
all its horrors, but the soul above is undisturbed by the tumult,
for no storm can ruffle the calm surface of the sea of
glass.&nbsp; There may be bitter sorrow filling many a broken
heart, but it is unknown there, for as God <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>himself has
undertaken to wipe away all tears from their eyes.&nbsp; No fears
or doubts are known there, for they are all allayed and scattered
by the actual presence and perceptible love of their Saviour
himself in the very midst of them.&nbsp; Above all there is no
sin there.&nbsp; While sin lasts there can be no repose; but
there, sin never enters; it may be sought for, but cannot be
found, for it is all blotted out by the blood of the Lamb, and is
remembered no more before the throne of God.&nbsp; And so it is
with the beloved spirit now departed.&nbsp; She has wept, and
those who knew her best remember well what a true mourner she
was, and how deep was her feeling of heartfelt grief when it
pleased God to remove from her the dear relatives whom she
tenderly loved.&nbsp; But she weeps no more; every tear is dry,
and every sorrow passed for eternity.&nbsp; She has had her
fears, her doubts, her conflicts of soul, but there are none now;
her race is run, she rests in her Lord, she sleeps in
Jesus.&nbsp; She has struggled against sin, she has wrestled with
God for holiness, as many of <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>you know well, who have had the
privilege of uniting with her in the outpourings of her soul
before the throne.&nbsp; But it is all past now.&nbsp; There is
not a spot in the white robe: she reposes a spotless conqueror
before God.</p>
<p>As to all that may distress, therefore, there is repose.&nbsp;
But as to the sinless emotions of a living soul, we have the
clearest evidence of Scripture that there is all the joy of
activity without fatigue.&nbsp; No! there is no stupor, nor any
want of consciousness to that light and lovely spirit.&nbsp; It
is all life now, and life unfettered by the clogs and hindrances
of decaying flesh.&nbsp; Memory is not dormant, for remember the
vivid glow of gratitude with which the living ones before the
throne adore the Lamb for having redeemed them by his blood from
the various nations of mankind.&nbsp; Nor hope, for in that same
song we find the joyful anticipation of their future reign.&nbsp;
Nor praise, for the language of heaven is full of praise; and
wherever the ransomed spirits speak it is in praise.&nbsp; Think
not that the love is lost <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>or deadened, for these sweet hymns in
which so many amongst you have so often rejoiced to join with the
departed.&nbsp; It is dangerous in such a matter to attempt to
draw aside the veil, and we must not venture to let go
imagination; but yet it seems as though we could almost perceive
the new joy at the new song; the deep emotion, the elevated
expression, and the hallowed animation with which she has already
taken her place in the blessed chorus before the throne of her
Lord.</p>
<p>When, therefore, we speak of sleeping in Christ, we must not
understand a state of insensibility, or any want of
consciousness; but of sacred rest, of conscious, intelligent
rest, in the peaceful enjoyment of the presence of the
Lord.&nbsp; But as stated already, this rest, however glorious,
is only the intermediate state, and it is mentioned as it were,
incidentally, while drawing your thoughts to the crowning
point&mdash;the grand expectation of the church of Christ.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Let us consider then, secondly, <i>The bright hope
of the whole family</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>By the
whole family, we mean the whole vast multitude of the children of
God, &ldquo;the whole family in heaven and earth;&rdquo; now
divided for awhile into two classes, the living and the departed;
but really one in Christ, and about to be one in their common
enjoyment of the blessings of his advent.&nbsp; Of these two
portions neither has reached beyond the range of hope.&nbsp; The
blessedness of the departed is unbounded now, but there are
greater things in store for them; their cup seems full, but it
shall be fuller still when Christ comes.&nbsp; The resurrection,
not the death-bed, is the hope of the believer.&nbsp; We look not
so much to the day when we enter the grave, and dear friends in
bitter weeping part with us, as to the happy hour when we shall
quit it, and those same friends rejoicing rise with us.</p>
<p>To this long expected hour the passage clearly refers,
&ldquo;For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so
them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.&nbsp; For
this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are
alive <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and
remain, shall not prevent them which are asleep.&nbsp; For the
Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the
voice of the Archangel, and with the trump of God; and the dead
in Christ shall rise first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first point to be here noticed is clearly <i>the
resurrection</i>.&nbsp; Death has been already said to be but a
sleep, for it is not permanent.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is not dead but
sleepeth,&rdquo; may be applied to her whom we left in the grave
on Friday.&nbsp; That grave shall shortly give up its tenant, and
very body, that tendering beloved body, shall arise again in
fresh life and beauty.&nbsp; As the springs from the acorn, and
the butterfly from the chrysalis, so shall that animated form
rise forth with a fresh and heavenly animation; that very hand
shall hold the palm, and that very voice unite once more in the
praises of her Lord.</p>
<p>But though the same, it will be infinitely more
glorious.&nbsp; You have seen lately a beautiful planet shedding
its soft light over the ocean, and, evening after evening, it <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>has appeared
very lovely, but yet how far does it fall short in splendour of a
summer&rsquo;s sun in a cloudless sky!&nbsp; Just such we are
taught in 1 Cor. xv, 41, is the wonderful difference between the
dying and rising body.&nbsp; It was a bright and beautiful star
that has been shedding forth its lovely light these many years in
the midst of you; but, though beautiful, it is not to be compared
to what we are about to behold in the resurrection.&nbsp; It was
sown in corruption, little by little laying her low; but it shall
be raised in incorruption, no more to be silenced by disease, or
to give up through decay of strength.&nbsp; It was sown in
dishonour and though dearly loved must be buried from the view;
but it shall be raised in glory, to form a part of the triumphant
retinue of the King of Kings.&nbsp; It was sown in weakness, and
perhaps it was one of the most beautiful features of her
character that that weakness was so meekly met, and so cheerfully
submitted to; but it shall be raised in power, the power of
undying <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>strength, and everlasting life from God.&nbsp; It was
sown a natural body, subject to the multiplied infirmities of a
ruined, fallen, sin-stricken humanity: and none felt their
hindrances more than she did; but it shall rise a spiritual body,
fully fitted for spiritual work, without impediment and without
decay.&nbsp; Can we wonder then that with such a prospect full in
view, the Apostle should write to the bereaved Thessalonians, and
remind them &ldquo;concerning those which are asleep, that they
sorrow not even as others which have no hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this is not all.&nbsp; There is another blessing promised,
and that is <i>reunion</i>.</p>
<p>The great sorrow of this day is separation.&nbsp; It is a
sense of separation, of loss, and bereavement, that has drawn
forth so many tears.&nbsp; Indeed there is little besides to
cause a tear.&nbsp; As far as she is concerned there is no cause
for sorrow.&nbsp; If ever there was one of whom it might be said
&ldquo;she fought a good fight, she has finished her course, she
has kept the faith,&rdquo; it was of her.&nbsp; She was one who
walked before God faithfully, who <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>loved affectionately, who laboured
cheerfully, who trusted simply, who rejoiced unfeignedly, and now
she has sunk gently into the arms of her Lord, to repose there in
perfect peace till the time comes when she shall be called forth
to accompany His advent.&nbsp; Can we say there is sorrow in all
this?&nbsp; Can we exclude the thoughts of even joy at such a
conclusion of such a course?&nbsp; Yes, there is sorrow, and that
because there is separation, and wherever there is true
affection, the separation, however peaceful, must leave a void
which nothing else upon earth can fill.&nbsp; The home is left
desolate after all, and however sweet the assurance for the
departed above, the heart still aches when left alone to tread a
solitary path below.&nbsp; How beautifully then is this met in
the passage!&nbsp; There is to be a reunion as well as a
resurrection.&nbsp; We shall not rise separately, but as a
reunited body in Christ.&nbsp; There is one beautiful clause that
clearly teaches this,&mdash;&ldquo;Then we which are alive and
remain, shall be caught up, <i>together with them</i>, in the
clouds.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that our <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>blessed Lord when he comes against
will not merely restore life, but companionship.&nbsp; He will
undo all that death is doing.&nbsp; Death kills, He raises; death
divides, He unites; death keeps us at a distance from those who
are gone before, He brings us once more together, so that with
them we should have the joy of one common life and glory.&nbsp;
Nor will the ties of life be lost or forgotten in that new and
sacred fellowship.&nbsp; The strong affections which God has
planted will not be obliterated in the grave; for you remember
that remarkable passage in this very epistle, in which the
Apostle anticipates the joy of meeting these very Thessalonians
at that blessed hour.&nbsp; In chap. ii, 19, he says &ldquo;What
is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?&nbsp; Are not even ye
in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his
coming?&rdquo;&nbsp; He clearly then expected to meet and
recognize these converts at that day.&nbsp; For nearly 1800 years
both he and they have slept in their graves, but the close and
intimate tie that then united them shall appear with undiminished
strength in their <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>resurrection, and the risen Apostle shall rejoice in his
risen converts before the Lord.&nbsp; Then will be the day for
the regathering of broken families, and the healing of broken
hearts.&nbsp; Then will be the reunion of the minister with the
people, of the parent with the child, of the brother with the
sister, of the husband with the wife; a reunion without the
possibility of separation, for there shall be no more death, and
the promise is that together with them we shall ever be with the
Lord.</p>
<p>But the passage carries us one step higher still, viz: to
<i>the uninterrupted enjoyment of the presence of our Lord
himself</i>.</p>
<p>There is first the resurrection, then the reunion, but the
crowning promise of the whole is an everlasting fellowship with
Christ himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;So shall we ever be with the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now this must ever be the longing desire of
the child of God.&nbsp; Nothing created can ever satisfy the soul
that is born again of the Spirit.&nbsp; Friends may cheer, and
counsel, and animate, and sympathize, but they cannot really
satisfy, and a union <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>with Christ is the only thing that
can give abiding peace.&nbsp; You, whose privilege it was to
kneel beside the loved and departed one in prayer, and to unite
in the outpouring of the soul before her God, you can well
remember how ardently she thirsted for Him; not merely for his
gifts but for himself, that we might be satisfied with his love
and filled with his Spirit.&nbsp; It was this ardent desire that
led to her early rising in winter and summer, in order that she
might make use of the blessed privilege of communion with
God.&nbsp; It was this that made the Lord&rsquo;s day a delight
to her soul, for she could rejoice in it as one altogether
separated unto him.&nbsp; She thirsted to have her soul filled
with the love of Christ, and when we reflect on such a character,
what a power is there in the promise, &ldquo;So shall we ever be
with the Lord&rdquo;!&nbsp; Then all thoughts will be absorbed in
him, all hearts satisfied in him; and whether we be found among
the living to be changed, or the dead to be raised, all will be
one in him, to behold his glory, to hear his voice, to wonder at
his <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>love,
and though faintly, yet sinlessly, to reflect his
character.&nbsp; &ldquo;Beloved now are we the sons of God, and
it doth not yet appear what we shall be, but we know,&rdquo; we
do not merely think, or hope, but we <i>know</i>, &ldquo;that
when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him
as he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such then is the blessed hope with which our God has directed
us to comfort each other in the day of sorrow; and though our
perception of it be but imperfect, we must all admit that it is
sufficient.&nbsp; If this be not enough what more can we
require?&nbsp; But before we close it is important that we all
bear in mind that there is a limitation to the promise; not
indeed as to the excellence of its rich gifts, but as to the
persons by whom these gifts will be enjoyed; and there are two
short clauses in the passage, which though short are very full,
and mark with the utmost clearness who those are that shall be
partakers of this blessed life.&nbsp; They are those who
&ldquo;sleep in Jesus&rdquo;; or in other words those who are
&ldquo;dead in Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole work is the simple
result of the great <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>and perfect redemption wrought out by our Blessed
Lord.&nbsp; If it had not been for the atonement there could have
been no forgiveness, and no fellowship with God; and without his
resurrection there could be none to follow for his people.&nbsp;
All springs from redeeming Love, and all is enjoyed simply though
Christ.&nbsp; Those that are without Christ must be given up to
hopeless sorrow, for to them the passage is without its
joy.&nbsp; But to those who are in him; not merely in his church,
but in him; forgiven through his blood, justified through his
righteousness, baptized by his Spirit into his body, to them the
words are full of inexpressible consolation, and present a
prospect so brilliant that it may well raise the heart above the
sorrow of the intervening separation.</p>
<p>The great, grand, lesson for the day is therefore this, that
we each one seek, and that without delay, for this unchanging
union with Christ.&nbsp; You have seen amongst you the fruits of
such a union, you have had residing in your midst for the last
twenty-five years one who was without a <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>doubt in
Christ; who, I would rather say, is in Christ, who is with
Christ, and who will rise in Him at his appearing.&nbsp; You have
seen the character formed on such a union.&nbsp; You have
witnessed the holy peace, the warm affection, the brightness of
Christian joy, the tender and ever ready sympathy, the untiring
zeal for souls, the patient labour, and the earnest endeavour to
bring poor sinners to their Saviour.&nbsp; All this you have seen
yourselves.&nbsp; Nor must we lay it down simply to natural
character or inborn qualifications.&nbsp; We do not exclude
these, for there was undoubtedly a beautiful character as the
basis; but it was the union with Christ that gave to all its true
beauty.&nbsp; It was the gift of the Holy Spirit earnestly sought
in unceasing supplication before God.&nbsp; There never yet was
one more ready to confess her own utter nothingness, or who felt
more deeply that Christ Jesus, and Christ Jesus alone, was her
every and only hope.&nbsp; And we must enjoy the same union if we
would glorify God.&nbsp; Do we wish to walk in the steps of those
that are gone before, or rather <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>to follow Him whom they
followed?&nbsp; We must seek the strength to do so in this union
with Christ.&nbsp; Do we want to overcome sin, to fight manfully
against the corruption of a depraved and fallen nature?&nbsp; Our
only hope, and, thanks be to God! it is sufficient, is in this
union with Christ.&nbsp; Do we desire to labour for God, and like
her that is gone, to spend the powers which He has given in the
delightful effort to gather in poor sinners to his kingdom?&nbsp;
As the work must be for Christ, so the power must be in Christ,
and the whole blessing granted through a union with Him.&nbsp; Do
we wish to be able to meet the day of sorrow, and when the heart
is overwhelmed to repose peacefully in the sure fidelity and
tender sympathy of a gracious God who has loved us with an
everlasting love?&nbsp; Again are we driven to the necessity of
the same union, for through Him it is that the Holy Comforter
descends into the soul.&nbsp; And do we desire to pass peacefully
through the valley of the shadow of death, to be kept at peace
when all around us fails, when the outward man decays, when <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>the voice
becomes silent, and the eye dim?&nbsp; Do we wish then to fall
asleep in perfect safety?&nbsp; Our hope must be in that same
blessed union with that same blessed Saviour; for not merely in
the present may we then look up and say &ldquo;I will fear no
evil for thou art with me,&rdquo; but we may look beyond the
valley and add &ldquo;Them that sleep in Jesus will God bring
with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let this then be the deep impression produced by the
day.&nbsp; Let us go home to consider well the nature and
evidence of our own union with Christ.&nbsp; You, dear children
in the schools, for whom it may be well said, that she
&ldquo;travailed in birth till Christ be formed in
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; You young persons that have grown up under her
care, and over whom she has watched with almost a maternal
interest, since the day that you first crossed the threshold of
the infant school.&nbsp; Take good heed every one of you to this
great subject, and God grant that when Christ comes, like her,
you may be found in Him.&nbsp; You that have been members of her
different classes, and have had the privilege <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>of uniting
with her in the sweet communion of prayer and Christian
intercourse, let the savour of those sacred hours long remain
with you, and let the recollection ever rouse you to fresh and
vigorous watchfulness as to your own union and abiding fellowship
with Christ.&nbsp; Ye that are mourners here this day: ye that
have come to this house of God with bleeding hearts.&nbsp; Dear
Brethren, let your hearts be comforted.&nbsp; Think of her union
with Christ.&nbsp; Remember well her past fellowship with
him.&nbsp; Think of her now as sleeping with him, and soon about
to return with Him.&nbsp; See what He has already done for her,
and let the thought serve to raise your own heart
heavenwards.&nbsp; Let it tend to satisfy your own soul in
Him.&nbsp; Let it lead you to say, &ldquo;All my fresh springs
are in <i>thee</i>,&rdquo; and may He &ldquo;supply all you need
according to his riches in glory by Chris Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, lastly, you that are still strangers to that blessed
Saviour; still unconverted persons, with the burden of sin still
on you; with no hope in the advent, and quite unprepared <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>to die; let
the death speak to your heart now if the life has failed to reach
it.&nbsp; Perhaps you may be young persons trained in the
schools, and under her influence from your very childhood, but
still strangers to Christ.&nbsp; Remember then the earnestness of
her exhortations, and the fervour of her prayers.&nbsp; Remember
how she longed for your souls, and let this be the last day
either of hardness or indifference.&nbsp; Could that voice speak
from the grave how earnestly would it now appeal to you, and let
the recollection of that voice now silenced move each stubborn
heart to turn to God.&nbsp; The offer is now made to you, and
none can say he is excluded.&nbsp; The atonement was made for
all, and the offer is made freely to each individual.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hear, and your soul shall live.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
impossible that any offer more magnificent could be made to the
sinner.&nbsp; Here is pardon, peace, joy, union, resurrection,
and everlasting fellowship with God, all offered to the most
guilty sinner, and all without money and without price.&nbsp;
Shall men remain hardened?&nbsp; Shall the sinner remain
indifferent?&nbsp; Shall there <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>be none this day resolved to cast
themselves at his feet, that all sin may be blotted out through
his blood, that when they depart hence, they may sleep in Him;
and that when the trumpet shall sound, they may rise at his
bidding, and spend eternity in the full enjoyment of his
everlasting love?</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
